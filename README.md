# Codility React 16 Todo's challenge BS in 2023
Shell uses codility to serve tech challenges to possible new Senior React Freelance developers. 

## Context
The question is not outdated but... However the development environment of Codility is. Unless the company that you are doing this tech challenge for is actually using still developing using React 16.XX.XX that came out in 2017.

## The Challenge Description
```
Users should be able to add items to a list
Use the <input> element to accept user input for the todo list item 
use a button element to append the text in the  <input> element as an item to the list an clear the <input> element.
Use <li> elements for todo list as childeren of <ul> element. Todo list items should not be empty and there can be multiple items with the same value.

Users should be able to mark/unmark items as completed>
Cross (Strikethourgh_ the <li> element when clicked to indicate that the item is  completed by adding "is-done" class to the <li> element.
Undo the cross when the item is clicked again by removing "is-done" class from the li element.

Display a status message with the number of remaining tasks as "X remaining out of Y tasks" where X = number of the incomplete tasks, Y = the total of items in the list. Add "task-counter" class to the status message ("X remaining out of Y tasks") elelment.
```

The starting point
```
Add code to 
export default class TodoList extends Component {
  render() {}
}
```

## Conclusion
If your going to do a code challenge and have developers spent time working on it. You should make sure that it is relevant to the actual stack and best-practices of the company. And with the challenge using React 16 from 2017 it is not. Especially, as this Class based way of doing React has be deprecated relative to the Functional based approach. The classed based documentation has be removed from the React site.
Thus, anyone who has been doing React for last few years will be very suprised.

### Goal of the challenge: Onboarding best possible people.
Hell no.. with a few simple questions this challenge could be avoid. It's basically a waste of time and money on the client and freelancer side. Especially if its outdated.
If it where up-to-date and for an internal position to verify if a junior has a base of understanding. But for a senior React freelancer this is a waste of time and money IMO.
* Longer intake processes are considered a bad experience.
* Not looking at the github of the person that has more complicated code that in this challenge could be a read fleg for developers not to join.
